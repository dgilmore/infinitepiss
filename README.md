# Project Title

Infinite Piss is a Portland Area Music & Art Zine. The website for the zine was built as my final project for undergrad section of Full-Stack Web Development at Portland State University. The site includes a homepage, which has a news section, a contact form(not working as of 12/5/2018). There is one completed zine page, including a thumbnail photo gallery for the zine implemented using an external JS library.  The issue page also includes a links section, containing all the artists links and a media player to stream a playlist of bands.
